# odin-recipes
This project is a basic website of recipes of my favorite foods. This is my first project while going through
the Odin Project curriculum and won't look pretty at first since this is built using basic HTML. I will revist
this project to add styling using CSS.

## Skills
Skills I will have demonstrated once completed:
- Basic HTML such as
    - Paragraph element
    - Anchor element
    - Image element
    - Lists
        - Ordered
        - Unordered
    - Header elements

## Thoughts
So far the project wasn't too bad. I had fun building this project and can't wait to start styling it using CSS.
I'll continue to work on this and make it look more appealing to look at, while also practicing more HTML and CSS.

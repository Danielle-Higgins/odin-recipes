I built this using just html and css. There's more than one html file however.

## Optimizations

If/when I improve this project, I would start by making it more responsive. I would also like to have more than just three recipes available. I would do some research to see if there are any APIs that I could use.

## Lessons Learned:

Separation of concerns. How to link to external html files.
